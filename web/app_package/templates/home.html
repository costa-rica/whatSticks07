        What Sticks (WS) is a sleep and weather tracking application. There have been studies that trace the temperature you sleep in with the quality of sleep you get. This is a step in trying to measure this in a personalized way. WS believes that we have access to too much technology and data to be taking references to broad averages. Instead, we should be personalizing health and wellness.
          <br><br>
  
          Once register and the account is updated with the Oura Ring Token and location information WS will collect your Oura Ring Sleep Score and the average temperature of your location.
          <br><br>
  
          As the data accumulates you will be able to see the correlation between your sleep score and the temperature.
